# External Recipe Duplication Fix

## Problem

The TasteBite application had an issue with external recipes from MealDB being duplicated in the database, causing:

1. Multiple identical recipes appearing in the Home page and Admin panel
2. Confusion for users viewing the same recipe multiple times
3. Wasted database space and inconsistent user interactions

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by two main problems:

1. **Ownership Assignment**:
   - In `get_or_create_external_recipe`, external recipes were assigned to the current user
   - In `import_external_recipe_json`, external recipes were assigned to the system user
   - This inconsistency led to duplicate recipes with different owners

2. **User Profile Logic**:
   - The user profile fetched "imported" recipes based on user ownership, leading to inconsistent views

## Solution

The following changes were made to fix the issue:

1. **Consistent System User Ownership**:
   - Modified `get_or_create_external_recipe` to always assign external recipes to the system user
   - This ensures all external recipes have the same owner

2. **Improved User Profile Logic**:
   - Updated the user profile endpoint to find external recipes by user interactions
   - Instead of looking for is_external=True recipes assigned to the user, it finds recipes the user has interacted with

3. **Fix Existing Data**:
   - Added a script `fix_duplicates.py` to:
     - Find duplicate external recipes (same external_id)
     - Assign them to the system user
     - Merge all user interactions (favorites, ratings, comments)
     - Delete the redundant copies

## How to Run the Fix

To fix existing duplicate recipes in the database:

```bash
cd tastebite-backend
python fix_duplicates.py
```

## Testing

After applying these changes, test the following:

1. Navigate to an external recipe page from MealDB
2. Refresh the page or revisit it later - verify it doesn't create a duplicate
3. Check the Admin Panel - verify no new duplicates appear
4. Check the User Profile - verify external recipes are still visible

## Additional Notes

- External recipes are now only assigned to the system user
- Users can still interact with external recipes (favorite, rate, comment)
- The system tracks which external recipes a user has interacted with 
- This approach keeps the database clean while maintaining all user interaction features
